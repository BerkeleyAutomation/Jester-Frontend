<h2>Dataset 1: 4.1 million ratings</h1>
<h3>Values from (-10.00 to +10.00) of 100 jokes from 73,421 users: collected between April 1999 - May 2003</h3>
<p>

<p>
The text for each of the 100 Dataset 1 jokes can be downloaded here: <a href="jester_dataset_1_joke_texts.zip">jester_dataset_1_joke_texts.zip</a> (92KB)

<ol>
	<li>100 files</li>
	<li>Each file has name init1.html,...,init100.html</li>
	<li>The numbers refer to the ID's of the jokes in the Excel files</li>
</ol>
<p>
The ratings data:
<p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="jester_dataset_1_1.zip">jester_dataset_1_1.zip</a>: (3.9MB) Data from 24,983 users who have rated 36 or more jokes, a matrix with dimensions 24983 X 101.</li>
	<li><a href="jester_dataset_1_2.zip">jester_dataset_1_2.zip</a>: (3.6MB) Data from 23,500 users who have rated 36 or more jokes, a matrix with dimensions 23500 X 101.
	<li><a href="jester_dataset_1_3.zip">jester_dataset_1_3.zip</a>: (2.1MB) Data from 24,938 users who have rated between 15 and 35 jokes, a matrix with dimensions 24,938 X 101.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
Format:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Data files are in .zip format, when unzipped, they are in Excel (.xls) format</li>
	<li>Ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00 (the value "99" corresponds to "null" = "not rated").</li>
	<li>One row per user</li>
	<li>The first column gives the number of jokes rated by that user. The next 100 columns give the ratings for jokes 01 - 100.</li>
	<li>The sub-matrix including only columns {5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20} is dense. Almost all users have rated those jokes (see discussion of "universal queries" in the above paper).</li>
</ol>

	as users and columns as jokes. The left-most column contains the total amount of jokes
	rated by the user. There are a total of 54905 users
	and 150 jokes in this dataset.</li>
<li> 22 of these jokes have few ratings as they
were removed as of May 2009 deemed to be out of date (eg, Bill Clinton jokes;)
their ids are:
